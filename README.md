# Face Authentication System Using Facenet Unified Embedding

This project is an implementation of the [FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf), utilizing TensorFlow for the machine learning architecture. The core idea behind this system is to enable secure user authentication through facial recognition.

## Overview

The system leverages the power of deep learning to extract facial features and create a unique embedding for each user's face. This embedding serves as a digital fingerprint, allowing for accurate identification and verification during the authentication process.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: Utilizes TensorFlow to implement the Facenet model for facial feature extraction.
- **User Authentication**: Authenticates users by comparing their facial embeddings against stored profiles.
- **Secure Storage**: Safely stores user facial data and corresponding embeddings for privacy and security.

## Usage

To set up and run the face authentication system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have TensorFlow installed (`pip install tensorflow`).
3. Run the setup script to prepare the environment (`python setup.py`).
4. Start the server with `python main.py`.
5. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:PORT` to begin the authentication process.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Flask (for serving the web interface)
